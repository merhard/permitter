= Permitter Specs

== Running the specs

To run the specs first run the +bundle+ command to install the necessary gems.

  bundle

Then the migrations for the dummy app must be run. Move to the dummy app root and run the migrations.

  cd spec/dummy
  rake db:migrate
  rake test:prepare
  cd ../..

Finally, from the root of the gem, run the +rake+ command to run the specs.

  rake

The specs currently require Ruby >= 1.9.3
They may or may not work with other Ruby versions.
